## Recent Updates

### September 27, 2025 - Added Statistics Page

Its here! A nice statistics page with details on:

- Total Matches
- Total Players
- Total Kills
And More!

I was silly and forgot to push the stats page. Added now! - 1:37pm UK Time.

3:38 PM :

Added in hero names to all pages it was broken. Took me a while but we *should* now be working!

18:32 PM:

Fixed the next/prev buttons, User page not properly registering the multiple pages, Other backend changes.

20:40 PM:

Added a cache to the match search. Helps with preventing needing to research the same match multiple times.

21:20 PM:

Added a Community Tab - If you feel you fit in to the community as a creator or provider of something key to the game, reach out on discord! My username is `j0nesy_`, where I can be found in the Deadlock, Deadlock Modding, and DLNS servers.

## Old Updates

### September 26, 2025 - Shot Statistics Added
Added shot hit/missed data to all matches from DLNS games. This data is now visible on:
- Match detail pages
- Player profile pages 
- Match history tables

Shot accuracy percentages are calculated and displayed on user profiles.

**Note**: Shot data is currently only available for DLNS matches. It may eventually be added to custom search functionality.

### Plans:
- Adding in Item buy progression throughout the match
- Showing final build in a match
- Better UX over whole site!
